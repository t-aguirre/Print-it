## ðŸ”¹ Dynamic Slider Features

This project includes a dynamic slider implemented with several key features to enhance the user experience. The slider showcases a full-width carousel that rotates through a series of slides, each with its own image and tagline. 

The functionality includes:

**Slide navigation**: Users can navigate between slides using left and right arrows. Clicking the left arrow decrements the slide index, cycling back to the last slide when the beginning is reached. Conversely, clicking the right arrow increments the slide index, cycling to the first slide when the end is surpassed.

**Automatic slide transition**: The slider features an automatic transition that changes slides every 3 seconds, providing a seamless viewing experience without manual interaction.

**Active bullet indicator**: The slider includes visual indicators at the bottom, which highlight the current slide. As the slide changes, the corresponding bullet change it style, indicating the active slide and ensuring users are aware of their current position in the carousel.

These features combine to create an engaging and interactive carousel that dynamically updates based on user input and time intervals.
